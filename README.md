# Recommender-System---Movielens.
 

A recommender system is one which works on the principles of the likes of Netflix and Amazon. 

There are usually three types of filtering principles:
          - Content based filtering.
          - Collaborative based filtering.
                  - User-User Collaborative Filtering. 
                  - Item-Item Collaborative Filtering. \n
                  - User-Item Collaborative Filtering. 
                  
This project is based upon the collaborative filtering procedure of computing the recommendations.
